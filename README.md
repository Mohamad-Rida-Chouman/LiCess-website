> An AI-Powered, Bioinformatics tool for predicting S-Nitrosylation (SNO) sites in proteins, helping in processes including - but not limited to - drug design, protein understanding...
>
> LiCess aims to provide a user-friendly experience for researchers interested in SNO-related studies and researches. It predicts the site of SNO in proteins using real-life data.

<!-- Prototyping -->

> We designed LiCess using wireframes and mockups, iterating on the design until we reached the ideal layout for easy navigation and a seamless user experience.

### Wireframes

### LiCess is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [React JavaScript library](https://react.dev/). React is an open-source, JavaScript library which allows us to building user interfaces based on components.
- For backend (database), the project uses the [Laravel PHP framework](https://laravel.com/) which follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design-pattern and provides a clean and elegant syntax that aims to simplify the development process.
- The app uses the font ["Roboto"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) as its main font.
